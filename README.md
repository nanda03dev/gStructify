# gStructify ðŸš€

A Golang package designed to generate high-performance backend services using fasthttp. It follows the Clean Architecture pattern, automatically generating the domain, infrastructure, handlers, and routing layers for each service, streamlining the development process.

## Layers Explained

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business models and domain logic. It defines entities and their relationships, encapsulating the business rules.

- **Application Layer**: Holds the business logic and use cases. It coordinates the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers, processing requests and responses.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages data access and external integrations (e.g., database interactions, third-party APIs). It provides concrete implementations for the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- **Interface Layer**: Contains HTTP handlers for routing incoming requests and managing responses. It may also include Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for structured data interchange between client and server.
