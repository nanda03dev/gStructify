# gStructify ðŸš€

A Golang package designed to generate high-performance backend services using fasthttp. It follows the Clean Architecture pattern, automatically generating the domain, infrastructure, handlers, and routing layers for each service, streamlining the development process.

## Features
- Automatically generates backend code structure for Go projects.
- Creates service folders with pre-configured Go modules.
- Simplifies repetitive tasks in setting up backend services.

## Layers Explained

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the core business models and domain logic. It defines entities and their relationships, encapsulating the business rules.

- **Application Layer**: Holds the business logic and use cases. It coordinates the flow of data between the domain and infrastructure layers, processing requests and responses.

- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages data access and external integrations (e.g., database interactions, third-party APIs). It provides concrete implementations for the repository interfaces defined in the domain layer.

- **Interface Layer**: Contains HTTP handlers for routing incoming requests and managing responses. It may also include Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for structured data interchange between client and server.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.XX or higher
- Dependencies specified in `go.mod`

## Installation

To install `gStructify`, run the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/nanda03dev/gStructify@latest
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to generate entries for your Go microservice:

### Step 1: Create a Microservice Directory
Create a directory for your microservice:
```bash
mkdir user-ms
```

### Step 2: Initialize a Go Module
Navigate to the directory and initialize a `go.mod` file:
```bash
cd user-ms
go mod init user-ms
```

### Step 3: Run the Generator Command
Run the `gStructify` command with your desired entity name:
```bash
gStructify -entity=user

create file with name `gStructify.config.json` and entity details refer sample config file below
note "key and values should be snake-case senstive"
gStructify 
```

This will:
1. Generate a structured set of files for the `user, order` entities.
2. Populate the necessary Go files within the `user-ms` directory.

Happy coding with `gStructify`!
